Commodore Amiga narrator.device emulator

## Background

The narrator.device is a speech synthesizer for the Commodore Amiga written by
Mark Barton and Joseph Katz. From what I understand, Mark Barton was responsible
for the speech synthesis, while Joseph Katz handled the systems integration. This
was more or less the same speech synthesizer as the original MacinTalk on the
very first Macs. It was the successor to SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) for the
Apple II, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers.

For more information, listen to an interview with Mark Barton on ANTIC The
Atari 8-bit Podcast.
